# Solar Panel Recycling Platform: India’s Recycling and Collection Gap


## Problem Statement
With the rapid adoption of solar panels across homes, schools, and commercial buildings in India, managing end-of-life panels has become a critical challenge:

- People do not know the remaining life of their solar panels.  
- There is no easy system to collect old or damaged panels from homes or institutions.  
- Safe recycling locations are not easily known or accessible.  
- Old panels are often stored, dumped, or sold to untrained scrap dealers.  
- This results in environmental pollution and wastage of valuable materials.

## Project Purpose
This repository is a **demo version** created for hackathon expert track evaluation.  
It presents a conceptual solution to India’s solar panel recycling and collection gap.

**Key Objectives:**
- Demonstrate a **user-friendly interface** for pickup requests.  
- Present **dashboard views** for Admin, Industry, and Users.  
- Visualize the **process flow** and system architecture.  
- Provide **mock API responses** for demonstration purposes.  

> Core business logic and sensitive algorithms are intentionally excluded to protect intellectual property.

## Demo Features
- **Pickup Request Form (Frontend Mockup):** Users can submit requests for old/damaged solar panels.  
- **Dashboard Views:** Conceptual dashboards for Admin, Industry, and Users showing request status (Pending, Collected, etc.).  
- **Process Flow Diagrams:** Illustrate the collection, transport, and recycling lifecycle.  
- **API Simulation:** Placeholder API endpoints to show system behavior.

## Folder Structure
/frontend - HTML/CSS pages for UI mockups
/backend - Demo APIs with mock data
/assets - Diagrams and flowcharts
## How This Demo Works
1. Users submit a pickup request (via frontend mockup).  
2. Admin or industry dashboard tracks and updates request status.  
3. Diagrams illustrate the complete lifecycle from pickup to safe recycling.  

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **demo repository** for hackathon evaluation only.  
> Core logic, algorithms, and production code are excluded to maintain intellectual property protection.
